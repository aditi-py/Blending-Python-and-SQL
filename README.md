# Weather Dataset Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a weather dataset in parquet format. The data set contains weather observations for a series of stations, summarized by day.

## Problems Solved:

### 1. Select all rows where temp is greater than 90 and windspeed is greater than 20.
### 2. How many unique stations met the condition of temp>90 and wdsp>20?
### 3. Find the top 10 stations where the condition is true.
### 4. Where is the top station (that is not 999999)?
### 5. What month/year was the hottest and windiest at that particular station?
### 6. Return summary statistics of the temp and wdsp columns.
### 7. Write a Pandas UDF that converts temperature from F to C.
### 8. Write a Pandas UDF that converts WDSP from knots to m/s.
### 9. Station Quality
### 10. Rolling Averages
### 11. Consecutive Values Above Threshold

## Conclusion

The project provided insights into the weather dataset, with analyses covering various aspects of temperature, windspeed, and station quality.
